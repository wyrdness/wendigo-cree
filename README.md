## Overview

The Wendigo (Cree: Wìhtikòw, also Wetiko) is a sacred spiritual being in Cree and Algonquian traditions that embodies the ultimate transgressions: cannibalism and the greed that drives it.

Described as gaunt and skeletal, associated with ice and cold, with insatiable hunger that grows with each victim, the Wendigo represents the spiritual and physical transformation that occurs when humans lose their humanity through greed or the act of cannibalism.

**This is not a monster story.** It is a profound spiritual teaching about:
- Survival ethics in harsh environments
- The absolute taboo against cannibalism
- Community interdependence and cooperation
- The dangers of placing individual desires above collective wellbeing
- The loss of humanity through greed

---

## Sacred Teaching Context

### Purpose

The Wendigo teaching developed in the context of:
- Severe winter conditions and periodic starvation
- Absolute dependence on community cooperation for survival
- Need to reinforce sharing and collective values
- Ultimate prohibition against cannibalism

### Core Lessons

1. **Cannibalism Taboo**: Eating human flesh is the ultimate transgression
2. **Greed Destroys**: Selfishness destroys both community and self
3. **Community Survival**: Individual must choose collective over personal gain
4. **Sharing is Survival**: Resources must be shared, even in scarcity
5. **Loss of Humanity**: Violation of these values means spiritual death

### Spiritual Meaning

**Transformation**: Humans who commit cannibalism or are consumed by extreme greed undergo transformation into Wendigo - they are no longer human but monstrous embodiments of that greed.

**Insatiable Hunger**: The Wendigo grows larger with each victim but is never satisfied - symbolizing the endless, destructive nature of greed.

**Ice and Cold**: Association with winter and frozen heart represents the loss of human warmth, compassion, and community bonds.

A historical term (debated by modern scholars) for a psychological condition involving compulsion toward cannibalism.

**Important Context**:
- Colonial-era documentation of cases
- Modern scholars debate: actual condition vs. colonial misinterpretation of cultural teachings
- Community response historically included execution of those believed transformed
- Must be understood in context of colonialism, cultural suppression, and trauma

**This requires Indigenous scholarly perspectives for appropriate understanding.**
