      "full": "The Wendigo in Cree tradition is a sacred spiritual being that embodies the ultimate transgression: cannibalism and the greed that drives it. Described as gaunt, skeletal, associated with ice and cold, with insatiable hunger that grows with each victim, the Wendigo represents the transformation that occurs when humans lose their humanity through greed or cannibalism. This is not a monster story but a profound spiritual teaching about survival ethics, the cannibalism taboo, community interdependence, and the dangers of placing individual desires above collective wellbeing. The concept has been severely appropriated and misused in horror media, causing ongoing harm to Indigenous communities. Understanding the Wendigo requires centering Cree and Algonquian voices and recognizing this as living sacred knowledge, not entertainment."
